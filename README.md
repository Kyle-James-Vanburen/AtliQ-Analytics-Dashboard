# S.T.A.R

SITUATION - AtliQ needs their attendance data to be more analyzed in 2022 for working preference. So, HR has provided me with four Excel CSV data sheets for their 2022 fiscal year. One sheet starting with Apr 22. A second sheet for May 22, and a third sheet for June 22. Along with those three months, I have an attendance key sheet to help track employee attendance records for 2022.

TASK - I need to know if employees prefer to work from home or do they prefer to work from office? With that question asked, I need to know the work from home percentage for employees. I will also need to know the sick leave percentage for employees. And, lastly, I need to know the percentage for employees who are present at work.

ACTION - Using Power BIs very powerful power query I collected and transformed the data from the excel sheets. Using the transform data option under the queries box in the home tab, I used the power query editior to apply my dax (Data Analysis Expressions) functions and operators to build my formulas and expressions to collect the needed data. With having the applied steps box on the right, I was able to keep track of my data transformation steps and functions. I made color coded area charts with the opposing key dashboard abbreviation color, in order to make the dashboard easier to read and understand. I also added a dotted trend line in each area chart to show any noticeable trends happening over time. To make the data of the dates more precise I added a slicer filter. Which allows me to see the data of all days from any selected month in the slicer.

RESULT - Because of my initiative, HR is now able to see a clear indication and prepare for the following May with May 2022 having the most sick leave percentage. HR is also now able to make better utilizations on rental space and able to save cost on infrastructure, with being able to see the percentage of who works from home. 






DASHBOARD KEY: 

P = Present 

SL = Sick Leave

WFH = Work From Home

Splicer Filter Top Right: You can select any month or all three, and it will change every visualization on the Dashboard to the precise data selected from the date.
